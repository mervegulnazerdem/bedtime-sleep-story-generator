    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we handle your personal data.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our application allows users to enter a name, age, and additional character in text fields for story personalization. These fields can contain any text the user chooses and do not need to include real names or ages. This information is sent to an external service, ChatGPT API by OpenAI, to generate a personalized story. We do not store or share this information beyond this purpose.</p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The name, age, and additional character entered by the user are used solely for generating personalized stories through the ChatGPT API. We do not store, share, or use this information for any other purposes.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the ChatGPT API provided by OpenAI to generate personalized stories. The information entered by the user (name, age, and additional character) is sent to this external service to process the request. OpenAI's privacy policy can be found <a href="https://www.openai.com/privacy">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Except for the name, age, and additional character entered for story personalization, we do not collect, store, or share any other personal information or data from our users. Our application does not require or request any other personal data to function.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information immediately.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>
